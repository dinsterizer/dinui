Here are roadmap of this projects:

- [x] Use native colors in Tailwindcss without learning anything new
- [x] Can be installed via package managers -> easy to receive updates
- [ ] Can be copied and used immediately without configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `components.json` -> easy to modify
- [ ] Multiple themes without using the `dark:` variant in Tailwindcss (optional for fast theme)
