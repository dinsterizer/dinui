Building forms with React Hook Form and Zod.

import Example from '@web/components/example.astro'

<Example path="ui/input/form" />

Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Has support for client and server side validation.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.

In this guide, we will take a look at building forms with [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com/) and [`zod`](https://zod.dev).
We're going to use a `<Form>` component to compose accessible forms using Radix UI components.

## Features

The `<Form />` component is a wrapper around the `react-hook-form` library. It provides a few things:

- Composable components for building forms.
- A `<Form.Field />` component for building controlled form fields.
- Form validation using `zod`.
- Handles accessibility and error messages.
- Uses `useId()` for generating unique IDs.
- Applies the correct `aria` attributes to form fields based on states.
- Built to work with all Radix UI components.
- Bring your own schema library. We use `zod` but you can use anything you want.
- **You have full control over the markup and styling.**

## Examples

See the following links for more examples on how to use the `<Form />` component with other components:

- [Checkbox](/ui/checkbox#form)
- [Day Picker](/ui/day-picker#form)
- [Input](/ui/input#form)
- [Input OTP](/ui/input-otp#form)
- [Radio Group](/ui/radio-group#form)
- [Select](/ui/select#form)
- [Switch](/ui/switch#form)
- [Textarea](/ui/textarea#form)
- [Combobox](/ui/combobox#form)
