## [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) but:

Here are roadmap of this projects:

- [x] Use native colors in Tailwindcss
- [x] Can be installed via package managers -> easy to receive updates
- [ ] Can be copied and used immediately without configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`, `components.json` -> easy to modify
- [ ] Dark mode or multiple themes without using the `dark:` variant in Tailwindcss or naming colors
- [ ] Extends component variants
- [ ] Figma `free`
